# Client Side Cowsay
Build a client side cowsay application. This assignment should contain an
express static server, a gulp file that can create a webpack bundle, an 
index that pulls in your bundle and has a cowsay 2-way data binding in
an angular app. Make sure to style your app using some css. As a bonus make
your app capable of changing the cow image to something else.
